## Let's generate real random number using IBM qiskit

Real random number generation for lottery-game using quantum computer(IBM qiskit)

### There are two mode for random number generation.

1) Simple random number generation using quantum circuit using qiskit library.
2) User birth-day entangled random number generation.
  - Applying user's birth-day to initial probability of the each qubit. It changes probability of the state after measurement.
  - Applying random entanglement between qubits using user's information

### Serviced Lottery Game

- **[Lotto(Korea)](https://dhlottery.co.kr/)**
  : Select 6 numbers in range 45

- **[Powerball(USA)](https://www.powerball.com/)**
  : Select 5 numbers in range 70 for 'white ball', 1 more selection in range 25 for 'power ball'

### Caution

- ** Although real random number generated by QC is more random than pseudo random number, it does not guarantee winning of the lottery.
